# PC-Optimizer-PRO
Script that analyzes your PC and speeds it up through advanced algorithmic math

## Getting Started
Easy clone:
```git clone https://github.com/JeremyEudy/PC-Optimizer-PRO```

## Install Dependencies
This program has no dependencies except for Python. My advanced algorithms make this process completely independent from any other codebase.

## Setup
Simply run the script using Python and watch in awe as the program analyzes your PC for errors and patches them, all the while giving you feedback in the form of a percentage and a loading bar.

## Running the Optimizer
Due to the incredible importance of this project, I've decided that multiplatform support is a necessity, and therefore I've ported the project to both \*NIX environments and Windows.

In \*NIX environments, simply run the script as below:
```python optimize.py```

In Windows, simply install Python and run the program from the icon.
